# Logex_API
The project is 3-layer(DAL, BL, PL) .Net Core API.

How to run application:
Set startup project to Presentation, build and run. Swagger UI is set up for brief testing.
To set logging, you need to specify the path parameter for Serilog in appsettrings.json

Changes made to SQLite File:
I have just deleted empty descriptions.

Cleaning data:
I did not had a much of context about the application so I have decided to clean up data in app before sending. I did not know if we want to keep this data or not. (e.g. html tags, spaces(/n)...)

I am aware of that some part of code are inefficient (e.g. implementation of my bonus task), but deadline is here.
